## Description

Modern applications often need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as writing data to a file or streaming audio/video without blocking the main application thread. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of multithreaded recording, allowing you to:
- Run multiple recording tasks in parallel.
- Manage synchronization between threads.
- Ensure stable performance even under high load.

This example can be useful for developers who want to understand the basics of working with threads and learn how to apply these principles in their projects.

## Features

- **Multithreading:** Demonstrates how to launch and manage multiple threads for data recording.  
- **Simplicity and Extensibility:** The code is written with clarity in mind, making it easy to modify and extend its functionality.  
- **Practical Example:** A real-world example of solving the concurrent recording problem, which can be adapted for specific needs.  

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure that the following components are installed on your system:

- **Programming Language and/or Platform:**  
  (Specify the language used, e.g., Python 3.x, C#, Java, C++, etc.)  
- **Libraries and Dependencies:**  
  (List the required libraries or frameworks and provide installation instructions if necessary.)  
- **Development Tools:**  
  (IDEs or build tools, such as Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, GCC, etc.)  

## Installation and Launch

1. **Clone the repository:**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkivHisink/MultiThreadingRecording.git
   ```
